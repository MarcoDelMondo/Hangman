# Java Hangman
A hangman game built in Java. The program will keep scores and allow you to keep playing with a new word as many times as you'd like.

## How It Works
1. Once the program has been compiled and run, you will simply follow on-screen instructions to guess letters and play hangman.
2. After finishing the game, your score will be displayed, and if it's a new high score, you will be prompted to enter your name. High scores are saved in the "res" directory as "highscores.txt"

## Configuration
- If you would like to view/edit the dictionary being used it is saved as "res/dictionary.txt"

## Dependencies
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
